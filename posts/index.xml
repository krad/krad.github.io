      <description>Apple has released a new project for non-blocking io, appropriately named swift-nio
It also released some SSL helpers for the project that allow you to create servers with encrypted communication channels.
swift-nio is quite new and Apple appears to be doing quite a bit of work on it. That means that documentation is pretty sparse for somethings at the moment.
One of those things is how to generate an SSL certificate for use with swift-nio</description>
